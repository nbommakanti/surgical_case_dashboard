# Surgical Case Dashboard

## Overview
This is an app to visualize cases completed during the course of an ophthalmology residency.

Try the app here: https://share.streamlit.io/nbommakanti/surgical_case_dashboard/case_viewer.py 

## Demonstration

First, download your ACGME case log from the [ACGME website](https://apps.acgme-i.org/connect/login).

You can upload your data like this:

Try switching between looking at your cases as *Primary* versus *Assistant* surgeon like this:
![](/gifs/primary_vs_assistant.gif)

These linked bar charts can be used to view your cases by *Area* (e.g. "Laser Surgery") and by *Type* (e.g. YAG capsulotomy)
![](/gifs/subset.gif)

The timeline can be used to look at your case distribution. You can hover and zoom in or out:

Next, you can see how much progress you have made toward the minimum residency requirements using either the interactive plot or the table (a similar table is available as a downloadable report from the ACGME):
![](/gifs/minimums_plot.gif)

Finally, you can examine the data table and sort or filter as you see fit:

You can expand the sidebar at any time to see instructions or to navigate to the ACGME website:
